# Link-State-Routing-Protocol-Implementation
1. Implemented a simulator of link state routing protocol using Python as the primary language and Tkinter library to design the GUI.
2. Simulated the process of generating connection table for each router in a given network, computed the optimal path with least cost       between any two specific routers.
3. The project also had the ability to handle situations where a router or the link between the routers fails.
4. Libraries used: Tkinter, matplotlib, networkx.
5. dijkstra_simulator.py contains the main source code.
6. matrix_gen.py contains the source code for generating a network by giving the number of nodes for testing purpose.
